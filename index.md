### About Me
      
I'm a user experience professional based in the Denver-Boulder metro of Colorado. I have over 14 years of digital experience spanning product design, research, team management, analytics, and front-end development. As RightScale's first designer, I evangelized user-centered design throughout the company. Later, I hired, mentored, and led the UX team to design software products which have been recognized as best-in-class by top analysts Forrester and Gartner.

I have a passion for creating well-designed products that are easy to use, and I value companies with an intrinsic drive to create the best user experience possible for their customers. I enjoy mentoring aspiring professionals and leading teams to craft great products that users love.
