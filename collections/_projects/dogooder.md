### Overview
As a graduate student, I participated in both the 2007 and 2008 International Computer-Human Interaction conference's student design competition with a group of other HCI graduate students. The [CHI guidelines](http://www.chi2008.org/student_design_competition.html){:target="_blank"} for 2008 were to "design an object, interface, system, or service intended to support the state of living without a house. Use methods of ethnography and contextual research to understand the problem space, and develop user-centered design solutions to support, assist, enhance or otherwise benefit your target audience."

### Challenges
* As a second-year student, I participated in the project entirely during my own free time, on top of my existing work and graduate class load.
* IRB concerns made it difficult to interview homeless populations directly, so we relied largely on second-hand information.
* Once accepted, we needed to gather funds to travel to Italy to present our findings.

### Results
Our team of 5 traveled to Florence, Italy and presented our poster. After the poster presentation, we advanced to the finals, where I presented our project to a panel of 3 judges and were awarded second place.

### Process
* We interviewed a variety of homeless service providers, volunteers, and people experiencing homelessness.
* We conducted literature research, then compiled our data in an affinity digramto	identify	major	issues	with homelessness.
* We used personas and scenarios to further flesh out our ideas	.
* We built a lo-fidelity paper prototype of doGooder, followed by a high-fi prototype in Adobe Flex.
* We then conducted user testing with several users to improve our prototype .
* We submitted a paper on doGooder to the CHI 2008 Student Design Competition, which was accepted.
* We presented a poster at the CHI 2008 conference, and advanced as one of the 4 finalists.
* We presented our teamâ€™s project to a panel of judges, and our team took 2nd place at the competition.
