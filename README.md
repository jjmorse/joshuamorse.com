This is the public-facing repository for my home page, [www.joshuamorse.com](http://bit.ly/2E3UPKd). It demonstrates the front-end code that I use to display my Jekyll-based web portfolio.

The site uses [Magnific Popup](http://bit.ly/2E579tM) and jQuery for lightboxes, but everything else was written by me from scratch.

Questions? Comments? You can [contact me](http://bit.ly/2E5RNoL) on my site.
