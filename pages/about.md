Welcome to my site! I currently live in Broomfield, CO, where I work remotely as a User Experience Manager for <a href="https://www.flexera.com" target="_blank">Flexera</a>, a leading provider of IT management software. Until the September 2018 acquisition, I worked for RightScale, the leading cloud management SaaS platform. I began at RightScale in 2010, and during my time there I evangelized user-centered design throughout the company and grew a team of talented designers and researchers who made RightScale the leading cloud management platform as measured by top analysts <a href="https://www.rightscale.com/lp/cloud-management-platform-magic-quadrant" target="_blank">Gartner</a> and <a href="https://info.flexerasoftware.com/SLO-WP-Forrester-Wave-Hybrid-Cloud-Management-2018-Report" target="_blank">Forrester</a>.

### My professional philosophy
* Whether it is designing a complex new product, building a team of talented designers, or hiking to the highest peak in Colorado, I set lofty goals and push myself to complete them. 
* I love mentoring aspiring professionals and seeing them grow in their career. 
* I believe that a key role for any manager is to create a comfortable space free from unnecessary distractions and stressors so that each employee can do their best possible work to create products that customers love. 
* I am a strong supporter of Lean principles, and I work to cultivate an environment where cross-functional teams of developers, designers, and product managers collaborate closely together to move stories forward rather than throwing deliverables over a siloed wall. 
* I believe in establishing KPIs for projects early and gathering the necessary data to measure success. 
* I am comfortable wearing many hats, and being an active contributor to design, user research, analytics, and front-end development.

### What I look for
In order to do my best work, I prefer an environment where: 
* Each team member is intrinsically motivated to do great work, and everyone celebrates each person's individual success as well as the team's success.
* Each person's ideas are carefully considered, but everyone is also comfortable moving past them if they aren't the best direction for a product. 
* Management, IT, HR, and internal administrators believe in enabling each employee to do their best work, not putting up barriers to long-term success in return for short-term savings.
* Good design is a core aspect of the culture, and decision makers believe that a poor user experience is a barrier to release rather than something to be ignored.
* Best-in-class tools are embraced. The best carpenters don't use discount department store hammers, and cheap computers and slow enterprise software ends up lowering morale and costing everyone time and money in the long run.
* A remote-friendly culture focused on recruiting the best people and embracing tools and processes that support remote collaboration.
* Regardless of background, anyone can succeed, diversity is celebrated, and harassment is not tolerated in any form.

### On the lighter side
Over the years, I have cultivated a variety of hobbies: 
* Like many Colorado residents, I enjoy the outdoors. 
    * In the summer, you will find me hiking, biking, and camping in the mountains
    * In the winter I may be skiing, snowshoeing, or curled up with a book in front of a fire.
* I'm an avid reader of both nonfiction and fiction (fantasy, mystery, and sci-fi being my favorite genres). 
* I have a <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/jjmorse" target="_blank">large collection of board games</a> and participate in several gaming meetups.
* I love theater, and have a membership with the Denver Center for the Performing Arts.
* I am active with political and non-profit causes, and in another life I would likely have studied law.
* I'm engaged with several local UX meetups, including serving as a mentor for [Hexagon UX](http://hexagonux.com/mentorship){:target="_blank"}.
